there are three types of errors and warnings:

* runtime errors : when the program doesn't do what you intended it to do during runtime. 
  this error causes the program to crush.

* compile time errors : errors you get when compiling. ex: syntax errors

* warnings : errors which are not serious (those which can not cause compile or runtime errors). ex: dividing by zero.
